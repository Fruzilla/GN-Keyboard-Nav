# GN-Keyboard-Nav
Enables easier navigation on GoNintendo.com with keyboard commands.

Instead of scrolling to the bottom of the page to access newer or older articles, this script will allow you to press the N key for older stories, and M for newer stories. You can also use J to jump down one story, K to jump up one story, and I to return to the most recent stories.

This is a userscript meant to be run in <a href = "https://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> or <a href = "https://violentmonkey.github.io/">Violentmonkey</a>.
