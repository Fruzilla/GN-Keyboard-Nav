# GN-Keyboard-Nav
Enables easier navigation on GoNintendo.com with keyboard commands.

Instead of scrolling to the bottom of the page to access newer or older articles, this script will allow you to press ctrl-left arrow for older stories, and ctrl-right arrow for newer stories. You can also use J to jump down one story, and K to jump up one story.

This is a userscript meant to be run in <a href = "https://tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> or <a href = "https://violentmonkey.github.io/">Violentmonkey</a>.
